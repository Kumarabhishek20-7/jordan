<p style="color: blue;font-size:larger;">Halloween's origins can be traced back to the ancient Celtic festival known as Samhain,
 which was held on November 1 in contemporary calendars. It was believed that on that day, the souls of the dead returned to their homes,
 so people dressed in costumes and lit bonfires to ward off spirits.</p>
